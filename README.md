## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use:**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill existing process
   netstat -ano | findstr :8081
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```

2. **Firewall Blocking Connections:**
   - Allow Node.js through Windows Firewall
   - Check router port forwarding settings

3. **Players Can't Connect:**
   - Verify server is running on port 8081
   - Check IP address and port
   - Ensure firewall/router allows connections

4. **Game Performance Issues:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
   - Close other browser tabs/applications

### Getting Your IP Address

**Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter.

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
# or
ip addr
```

### Key Development Concepts

1. **Server Authority**: All critical game logic runs on the server
2. **Message Broadcasting**: Changes are broadcast to all connected clients
3. **Item Normalization**: Consistent item structures across client and server
4. **Real-time Synchronization**: Continuous updates for smooth multiplayer experience
5. **State Management**: Centralized game state with client-side rendering

### Adding New Features
- Add new message types in the `ws.on('message')` handler in `server.js`
- Implement corresponding client-side handlers in `network.js`
- Update the game state structure as needed
- Ensure proper broadcasting of state changes

### Code Style
- **Consistent Naming**: All functions use camelCase, prefixed with `window.` when global
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- **Logging**: Use `window.log()` for game messages, `console.log` for debugging
- **Modularity**: Each file has a specific responsibility and clear interface

## Performance Considerations

- **Server Loop**: 60 FPS update rate for smooth gameplay
- **Message Optimization**: Only send necessary data updates
- **Client Rendering**: Local rendering with server validation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of disconnected players and dead entities
- **Canvas Optimization**: Efficient rendering with proper context management
